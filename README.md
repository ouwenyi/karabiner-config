# @mxstbr's Karabiner Elements configuration

If you like TypeScript and want your Karabiner configuration maintainable & type-safe, you probably want to use the custom configuration DSL / generator I created in `rules.ts` and `utils.ts`!

> “This repo is incredible - thanks so much for putting it together! I always avoided Karabiner mostly because of its complicated configuration. **Your project makes it so much easier to work with and so much more powerful. I'm geeking out on how much faster I'm going to be now.**”

Watch my interview with Raycast for a deeper dive into how I connect this with Raycast as my personal productivity system:

You probably don't want to use my exact configuration, as it's optimized for my personal style & usage. Best way to go about using this if you want to? Probably delete all the sublayers in `rules.ts` and add your own based on your own needs!

## Installation

1. Install & start [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Delete the default `~/.config/karabiner` folder
4. Create a symlink with `ln -s ~/github/mxstbr/karabiner ~/.config` (where `~/github/mxstbr/karabiner` is your local path to where you cloned the repository)
5. [Restart karabiner_console_user_server](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/manual/misc/configuration-file-path/) with `` launchctl kickstart -k gui/`id -u`/org.pqrs.karabiner.karabiner_console_user_server ``
6. Add the `raycast-scripts` directory to your Raycast scripts by opening Raycast, going to the "Extensions" tab, searching for "Script Commands", click "Add Directories" and then choose the `raycast-scripts` directory in this repository
7. The "Open Google Calendar in Arc" script needs the calendar to have a specific name. For it to work, go into Arc, right-click on the pinned Google Calendar tab and rename it to `RAYCAST_TARGET_CALENDAR_TAB`. You may change this name, but you'll have to update the `open-calendar.applescript` file accordingly. Also, keep in mind that this name must be unique across all tabs you will ever have.

## Development

```
yarn install
```

to install the dependencies. (one-time only)

```
yarn run build
```

builds the `karabiner.json` from the `rules.ts`.

```
yarn run watch
```

watches the TypeScript files and rebuilds whenever they change.
